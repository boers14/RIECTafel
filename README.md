Welcome to the RIEC Tafel program.
Here technical information will be noted.

The used Unity version is: 2020.2.3f1.
The VR device tested for this device is: Oculus Quest 2.
Look-up minimal requirements for VR usage for what VR device you're using to make sure the program will run.

To help create the program some packages where used:

To create an actual world map the Mapbox SDK is used.
For Mapbox documentation visit: https://docs.mapbox.com/
For logging into the Mapbox account ask Arjen Cuijpers for login credentials.
Mapbox has a limit of a 100.000 request of location data per month (30 used +/- each time a user joins 
a discussion)
Watchout with upgrading Unity to a higher version as Mapbox can crash on higher Unity versions.
Dont move the Mapbox folders in the package folder as this also results in Mapbox crashing.

For the multiplayer aspect of the program the Mirror package is used.
For Mirror documentation visit: https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/
The multiplayer currently only works if all users are on the same wifi network, else the program
will not be able to find other players

For the VR aspect of the program the XR plugin management & XR Interaction Toolkit are used.
For documentation on these visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html
A useful tutorial to get started on VR in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYtahQjmWQ
Watch this tutorial to understand the set-up used in this program.

For animations in the program the iTween package is used.
For iTween documentation visit: http://www.pixelplacement.com/itween/documentation.php

For the UI the TextMeshPro package is used.
For TextMeshPro documentation visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@1.3/manual/index.html



Besides these packages a database is hosted on: https://nl.000webhost.com/
Login into this website with the gmail account to get access to the database and files that run on the 
back-end.
The gmail account name is: riectafel@gmail.com.
For logging into the gmail account ask Arjen Cuijpers for the password.

For creating an Oculus account a connected facebook account is required.
The gmail used for this facebook account is: riectafel@gmail.com.
For logging into the facebook account ask Arjen Cuijpers for the password.

All the code in the back-end and program is commented, but no further documentation is created for the 
program.
